\q{20}{Dinner Time!}

It's dinner time! We're writing a function to check if we're having a complete meal. 

\textbf{Unscramble the following lines to complete the body of \texttt{isCompleteMeal}.} You will use each line exactly once.

Given a list of 3 elements containing food items, return $True$ if the 3 food items make a complete meal, meaning that it has one item from each category of appetizer, main, and dessert in no particular order. Return $False$ if the meal is incomplete.

\textbf{Use your \texttt{isCompleteMeal} function to fill in \texttt{numCompleteMeals}.} You can get full points for this part even if your previous function isn't perfect. However, in order to get full credit, your solution must fit in one line of Python. 

If you can’t figure out a one line solution, but have a correct solution, you’ll still get some points! Oh, and if you write big, don’t worry about that. “One line” means one return statement.
